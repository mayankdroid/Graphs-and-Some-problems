/*Depth First Traversal (or Search) for a graph is similar to Depth First Traversal of a tree. The only catch here is, unlike trees, 
 graphs may contain cycles, so we may come to the same node again. To avoid processing a node more than once, we use a boolean visited array. 
 For example, in the following graph, we start traversal from vertex 2. When we come to vertex 0, we look for all adjacent vertices of it.
 2 is also an adjacent vertex of 0. If we don�t mark visited vertices, then 2 will be processed again and it will become a non-terminating process. 
 Depth First Traversal of the following graph is 2, 0, 1, 3*/

/*Depth-first search (DFS) is an algorithm (or technique) for traversing a graph.

 Following are the problems that use DFS as a bulding block.

 1) For an unweighted graph, DFS traversal of the graph produces the minimum spanning tree and all pair shortest path tree.

 2) Detecting cycle in a graph 
 A graph has cycle if and only if we see a back edge during DFS. So we can run DFS for the graph and check for back edges. 

 3) Path Finding
 We can specialize the DFS algorithm to find a path between two given vertices u and z.
 i) Call DFS(G, u) with u as the start vertex.
 ii) Use a stack S to keep track of the path between the start vertex and the current vertex.
 iii) As soon as destination vertex z is encountered, return the path as the
 contents of the stack



 4) Topological Sorting


 5) To test if a graph is bipartite
 We can augment either BFS or DFS when we first discover a new vertex, color it opposited its parents, 
 and for each other edge, check it doesn�t link two vertices of the same color. 
 The first vertex in any connected component can be red or black!


 6) Finding Strongly Connected Components of a graph A directed graph is called strongly connected if there is a path 
 from each vertex in the graph to every other vertex. 

 7) Solving puzzles with only one solution, such as mazes. 
 (DFS can be adapted to find all solutions to a maze by only including nodes on the current path in the visited set.)
